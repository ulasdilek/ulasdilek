# CS junior at Bilkent University
* I can print hello world on a terminal. That must be something
* Coffee is my arch nemesis. But Java is my guilty pleasure
* I call myself a programmer but I don't know C++ as well as you
* I have had the opportunity of developing an Android app with a spaghetti code and no regard for a proper design structure
* I have had another opportunity to redeem myself with three other Android apps. They were less noodly. So it's a success!
* I am an algorithm enthusiast because it is a cool pair of words
* I think Python is a **sin** but I still have to use it from time to time :(
* I tell people that I run even though I haven't really run for a year
* I have a cool bicycle but my mom doesn't want me to use it outside the uni campus
* I bet you $50 I can drown faster than you
* This is as fancy as I can get with a readme file. I don't want to mess with the weird statistic widgets that some people use
